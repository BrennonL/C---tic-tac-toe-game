# Overview

My software is a simple two player tic tac toe game. It is all based in the terminal, and the players select the place they want to 
put their symbol by typing in a number between 1-9.

I created this software to learn more about C++. I wanted to practice using classes, functions, variables, and for loops in this language.
I also wanted to learn a language on my own, just so I could get the practice of doing so.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with a c++ extention. To compile the c++ I used the g++ minGW extention.

I used c++ to complete my Tic Tac Toe game.

# Future Work

* The first thing I want to do better next time is making sure I have fun with these sprints. These past two weeks I was stressed about this assignment and wasn't having fun until just a few days ago.
* The second improvement I wanted to make was to make sure I get most of my work done the first week instead of the second.
* The final improvement I wanted to make was to make sure I was more commited to my schedule that I planned for myself. For example when I planned 2 hours one day I would only get 1.5 hours in.
